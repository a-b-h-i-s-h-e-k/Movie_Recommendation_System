# Movie Recommendation System

# Overview
- This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. By utilizing collaborative filtering and content-based techniques, the system recommends movies that align with a user's taste or behavior.

# Features

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Cleans and processes the dataset to handle missing values and duplicates.
- Encodes categorical data for use in machine learning models.

2. Recommendation Techniques:

a. Content-Based Filtering:
- Recommends movies based on their metadata (e.g., genre, director, cast).

b. Collaborative Filtering:
- Suggests movies by analyzing user behavior and preferences.
- Combines techniques for a hybrid recommendation approach.

3. Evaluation:
- Measures recommendation accuracy using metrics like RMSE and Precision@K.
- Provides insights into the performance of the system.

4. Visualization:
- Displays recommended movies in a user-friendly format.
- Generates plots to understand user preferences and movie popularity.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

 # Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Numpy: For numerical computations.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning techniques.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Surprise: For collaborative filtering algorithms.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
- git clone <repository_url>

# Usage

1. Load Dataset:
- Import the movie dataset (e.g., ratings, movie metadata).
- Ensure the dataset is in the required format.

2. Run the Notebook:
- Follow the cells step-by-step to preprocess the data, train models, and generate recommendations.

3. Generate Recommendations:
- Provide a movie name or user ID as input.
- View personalized movie suggestions.

4. Applications

a. Streaming Platforms:
- Enhance user experience with personalized movie recommendations.

b. E-Commerce:
- Suggest products or services based on user preferences.

c. Entertainment Analytics:
- Understand viewing patterns and predict popular movies.
